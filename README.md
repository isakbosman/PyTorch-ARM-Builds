# PyTorch-ARM-Builds
LIst of torch arm builds. Mostly raspberry pi

# Install
Here's how to install with `pip3`

```
sudo pip3 install https://github.com/isakbosman/pytorch_arm_builds/raw/main/<file.whl>
```

Added because plain link to github file won't work (because it presents an HTTP page, rather than the raw file).
